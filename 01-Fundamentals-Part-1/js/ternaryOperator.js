/*
    steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant.
    In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300 if the value is different the tip is 20%

    1. your task is to calculate the tip, depending on the bill value, Create a variable called 'tip' for this. Its not allowed to use if/else statement.
    2. print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip and  the final value (bill + tip)

    test data for bill values: 275, 40 and 430

*/

// const bill = 40
const bill = 275
// const bill = 430

const fifteenPercent = (.15 * bill).toFixed(2)
const twentyPercent = (.2 * bill).toFixed(2)

const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ?
console.log(`the tip is 15% = $${fifteenPercent}`)  : console.log(`the tip is 20% = $${twentyPercent}`)
